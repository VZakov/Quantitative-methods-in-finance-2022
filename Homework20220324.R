#####Problem 1#####
# Write a function, which uses a loop to calculate factorial.
# The base R function is called factorial and you should replicate its result.
# This is a function, which takes two numbers, multiplies them and returns
# the result as output:
# MultiplicationFunction <- function(inputNumber1, inputNumber2){
#   Result <- inputNumber1 * inputNumber2
#   return(Result)
# }
# MultiplicationFunction(5, 3)
# 
# Write a factorial function:

# FactorialFunction <- function(inputNumber){
#   ???
#     return(Result)
# }

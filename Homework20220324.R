#####Problem 1#####
# Write a function, which uses a loop to calculate factorial.
# The base R function is called factorial and you should replicate its result.
# This is a function, which takes two numbers, multiplies them and returns
# the result as output:
# MultiplicationFunction <- function(inputNumber1, inputNumber2){
#   Result <- inputNumber1 * inputNumber2
#   return(Result)
# }
# MultiplicationFunction(5, 3)
# 
# Write a factorial function:

# FactorialFunction <- function(inputNumber){
#   ???
#     return(Result)
# }

#####Problem 2#####
#Write a function which takes a vector and returns its standard deviation.
#You should get the same results as the sd() function.
# SDFunction <- function(inputVector){
#   ???
#     return(Result)
# }
# ??? is not Result <- sd(inputVector)

#####Problem 4#####
#Find the following:
#4.1 For each carrier what is the most common destination?
#4.2 For each carrier what is the biggest delay?
#4.3 Which are the three plane which have flown the most/least miles?
#4.4 What are the first/last flights for each day in February 2013?
#4.5 Which company flew the most miles in March 2013? Which flew the least?
#4.6 Which month had the most delays over 60 minutes?
#4.7 What is the average time between two consecutive flights?
#4.8 Use the SDFunction function from exercise 2 to calculate the standard deviation
#of the flight delays for each month and for each destination.
